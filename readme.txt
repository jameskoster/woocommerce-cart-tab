== Description ==

Displays a link to the cart which is visible sitewide and fixed in position so it remains visible wherever the user scrolls. When the user hovers over the tab, the full cart widget is displayed.

There are options to display the cart tab on the right or the left, to use a light or dark skin to match your theme and to display the cart widget on hover or not.

3. Choose your display settings on the catalog tab of the WooCommerce settings screen
3. Done!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= It doesn't look like the screenshots on my site, what gives? =

This plugin uses CSS3 for things like animation, rounded corners and box shadows. If you're not using a modern browser then it might not look the same as the screenshots.

There is also the possibility that your theme is overwriting styles although that will be unlikely.
